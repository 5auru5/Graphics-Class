Big_Deep_Initial.png & Sinc_Graph.png are screenshots of the orginal code.
Big_Deep_Poly.png & Cosc_Graph.png are screenshots of the modified code.

The code included is the modified code. Additionally, I know the shape of Big_Deep.cpp is the big dipper, the instructions did say polygon so therefore the shape is closed instead of open.
